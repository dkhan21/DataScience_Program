Summary:
a simple language model is basically a model that can predict an output based on the data or context that was given before hand. For example, a model can predict the next word but in order to do that, it needs to be given some kind of data so that the model can be trained. Another example is with our assignment, we are using inout layers which are the input data and with that information the model can be trained in the hidden layer of a network. An output could then be created. It mainly recognizes the pattern and relationship in the data and predicts and output from there. With this kind of model, we can see data that hasn't been seen before.
In our assingment, we use multiple layers of neurons that are connected to each other. They are also known as hidden layers. Hidden layers take input layers and create output layers. Every single hidden layers passes information to the next hidden layer and each layer will help train the data. When training these model, we use a gradient descent algorithm. Also a loss function is created so that the difference can be seen from the actual result and the predicted result and update function is created to update the parameters of the model. These kinds of models use very unique techniques and it can prevent overfitting which can be caused from having too many hidden layers.
