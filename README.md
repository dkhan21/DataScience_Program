Instructions
I first downloaded Docker Dekstop and then I made sure I had WSL 2 enabled on the Docker and on my operating system.
Once I opened the Docker application, I created a new Container that had the link of my github milestone 1 branch.
From here, I ran container in vscode IDE.
After running vscode. I created an image so that I could have a container being run with it.
